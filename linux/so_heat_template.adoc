= Building a Security Onion HEAT Orchestration Template

I would like to take a base Ubuntu 14.04 image and download the Security Onion packages to be able to rapidly test with this image.

Follow the instructions for downloading at https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/InstallingOnUbuntu

Add the commands as user_data to a new nova server on a HEAT template.

Need to download and run sosetup using an answer file, or install an X Window Manager.

Need to generate the security onion setup.conf file
