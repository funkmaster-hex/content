= Debugging why I can't see bro logs

* Check that the interface is receiving traffic

I would like to bridge the wifi adapter (wlp2s0) to a NIC on a VM to capture traffic in bro

On the host

 $ tcpdump -i wlp2s0

I see lots of traffic...

On the VM, I bridged `eth0` to `wlp2s0` in the Virtual Network Editor


Show that it is bridged 

 $ ps -ef | grep wlp2s0

Restart the VM 

The interface `eth0` should be seeing traffic from `wlp2s0` if it is in promiscuous mode
