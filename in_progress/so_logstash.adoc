= Investigating why Logstash is not taking in all of the packets

== How logstash works

== Generate traffic and ship to the SO instance using syslog-ng

Recreate the lab environment as much as possible, try to get logstash to drop packets, how to test this?


Setting up a SO instance that is running Elastic Stack, but does not have a network sensor component.

I will forward logs from syslog-ng to the master computer

Need to learn how to forward logs from a computer to a master to ingest

== Architecture

Bro is running on the sensor logging files, syslog-ng does the logging, then syslog-ng ships the raw files to logstash that is listening on port 6050 of the master server.



== Steps

Install bro
