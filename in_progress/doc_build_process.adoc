= Documentation Build Process

It should take a minimally formatted asciidoc file and output something that looks nice, with links to other documents that match some content?

It should also have 'edit' buttons to help people jump into editing the documentation very quickly.

Documentation will be stored on github (or another git server)

Once a commit is done for master, then the documentation should get regenerated on the website instantly (people need to see their change)



Flow

Write Asciidoc
What will control the look and feel of the asciidoc? - some CSS file?


Structure of the documents?


Should use python and bash only - no perl!
